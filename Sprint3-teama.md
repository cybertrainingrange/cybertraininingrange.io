Tech is the fastest growing industry in the market right now, every day new innovations and advances are introduced to society. There isn't a place that hasn't been touched by technology. It encompasses as we do. Our paper maps have been replaced with google maps. Our health records can be accessed and stored online, The majority of our financial dealings are done electronically. All our most precious moments are captured with a camera and stored on our computers or phones. Online shopping is at an all time high. 
With the growing demand, companies are working effortlessly to catch up and utilize these new advances to their benefit. Some of the most vital parts to growing a company is through networking and scalability. No company can grow if no one is aware of their services, and the population that the company message reaches has to be in need of the services being provided. This is what makes networking so essential. As for scalability, a company must be able to know how to allocate resources. If a company is unable to properly allocate resources this can result in them being disorganized, lose finances, and be more vulnerable to cyber attacks. As an effort to help assist users obtain the tools to be able to successfully navigate these necessary components we have tested numerous applications on the AWS cloud that assist in networking and scalability.
When a company grows and begins to receive lots of revenue and traffic, this can become overwhelming and difficult to balance. Network Load Balancers is a useful tool for this. It is a tool that helps manage a large number of traffic targeted towards a specific web application by allowing you to make a target group to help direct traffic and allow you to direct the traffic where you want it to go.

| Communicating with other companies and accessing foreign data and business logic is an important part of networking. Finding means to do this in the most secure way with the least amount of vulnerabilities is vital for users. A service that is useful for this API gateway which is a service that acts as the entry point of communication between two users/applications. API gateway offers numerous benefits, including improved scalability, security, and flexibility. 
Demand changes in companies, and it is necessary that the company is able to acclimate and adjust with the changing demands. Autoscaling groups can be used on cloud computing services to allow users to automatically adjust resources such as virtual machines or containers as changes occur within their company.
Managing various different computing resources takes a lot of time and can be what breaks or makes a company's success as mentioned. Imagine if there was a service offered that manages underlying computing resources automatically based on events a user experiences. Look no further, AWS Lambda is the service for you. AWS Lambda is considered a serverless computing service and executes certain functions and commands based on the activity of the user. |

| Although it is great to have applications that automatically take care of the work for users, it is important for users to be aware of where these resources are being allocated and why. An application that helps measure and track metrics is Cloud watch, this will give you an overview of what resources are needed more or less. It offers monitoring and management services and allows users to get a thorough breakdown of what is going on behind the scenes with your resources.
Being able to organize a user's resources in a fashion that utilizes the least amount of memory, causes the least amount of financial stress and is the most optimal for organization and security sounds like an impossible dream for some users and companies, but fortunately we were able to compile some resources that can actually make this possible. |

| One of these applications is Docker, which makes managing applications and their deployment simple by the use of containers. A container is an isolated environment that acts as a package which holds certain user applications and resources. These containers are portable and reproducible.. 
Another amazing storage service is S3, which stands for Amazon Simple Storage Service. You might be wondering what makes S3 so unique. S3 does not store any files in a file system, it actually converts them and then stores them as digital objects. This technique is the reason users can upload their documents and files in the cloud storage system like they would with google drive or dropbox. |

| AWS offers a wide variety of other services that assist in assuring the success of users experiences such as VPC, bastion hosts, subnets. VPCs, or virtual private networks, allow users to create an isolated private network and when launched it is separate from the internet but can be connected through an internet gateway or nat gateway. Subnets can be created within VPCs to divide and control resources and network traffic. A bastion host is a server that can be used to retrieve resources for a private subnet to help reduce the private subnets exposure. All of these tools can be extremely useful for the scalability of a company while also helping with networking.
An essential part to security in your company's environment online is to ensure you can manage your network traffic, where your data can be sent, and who can have access to your data. Security groups allow you to implement this on your AWS cloud account. It allows you to control inbound and outbound traffic to different ec2 instances and set permissions.
Having a good database service is essential in the client-serving side of computing. Dyanmo DB and Amazon RDS are both useful databaseservices that make administration more manageable and are both highly scalable and reliable. These tools are available and offered by AWS. The main difference between these two tools is Amazon RDS is SQL based meanwhile Dyanmo DB is used for NoSQL data. |

| For a user to be able to navigate all these applications and  web services they would need an incredible operating system that allows you to have a secure environment, high speed, and a good amount of memory and storage. Linux operating system is a free and open source operating system. Yes, free. One of the biggest pros to linux outside of it being free to download and use, is that it works on on the surface layers of the OS model and is downloaded on with its own kernel embedded in it already. This is great for users who just want to experiment with a new OS without buying a new computer or changing their whole system. Linux can be downloaded on a virtual box or container such as docker and can be accessed through there. As you can see, linux is portable and has good accessibility.
These are just some of the few tools that can be utilized to help you be proficient in the online world. Overall, our goal has been to compile some incredible features to benefit others and summarize it in a concise way which is easy for people to comprehend. Becoming confident in the online world of networking and knowing how to make your business scalable are essential for success. By utilizing these tools, you will be able to succeed in the cyber world. |
